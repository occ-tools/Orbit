# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are recorded here. Orbit is pre-1.0; minor
versions may still include configuration or API migrations, which must be
called out explicitly.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Local authenticated Web UI with responsive chat, settings, cancellation, and
  live event streaming.
- DeepSeek V4 Flash/Pro routing, thinking-mode controls, cache telemetry,
  capability probes, and repeatable benchmarks.
- Persistent checkpoints, timeline rewind, custom slash commands, and
  cross-platform global CLI installation.
- Cross-platform CI, production dependency auditing, and CLI package-content
  verification.
- Versioned `doctor --json` support snapshots with strict automation status and
  workspace-path redaction.
- Explicit configuration schema versioning with safe legacy defaults and
  rejection of unsupported future formats.

### Changed

- Split the CLI command router, terminal UI, and Web UI into smaller ownership
  boundaries for safer maintenance.
- Hardened credential storage, workspace path verification, request redaction,
  and Web UI authentication.
- Bounded and validated LSP/MCP protocol input, redacted MCP process failures,
  and deterministic cleanup of autocomplete work.

### Fixed

- Prevented workspace traversal through added files and rollback paths.
- Prevented stopped Web UI instances from receiving events from later runs.
- Preserved prompt/history behavior and terminal fallback operation during the
  UI refactor.
