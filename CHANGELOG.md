# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are recorded here. Orbit is pre-1.0; minor
versions may still include configuration or API migrations, which must be
called out explicitly.

## Unreleased

## 0.1.9 - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added keyboard-accessible `/` command discovery to the Web UI composer and
  command palette, including validated project and user custom commands.
- Connected `/timeline` and `/rewind <id|number>` to Orbit's persisted file
  checkpoints with localized, bounded history output.
- Added model-callable `update_plan` for durable multi-step progress and
  `web_fetch` for bounded, redirect-safe public source retrieval.

### Changed

- Unified built-in slash command names, usage hints, localized descriptions,
  terminal help, completion, and Web UI discovery under one catalog.
- Preserved dynamic MCP JSON Schemas end to end, normalized provider-compatible
  tool names, and added cancellation plus collision-safe registration.
- Bounded and redacted file, search, shell, test, Git, web, and MCP tool output
  before it enters model history or the terminal status stream.

### Fixed

- Rejected malformed, duplicate, unknown, and schema-invalid model tool calls
  without crashing the agent loop or persisting invalid provider history.
- Kept tool cancellation, permission preflight, checkpointing, and DeepSeek
  tool definitions consistent across repeated model sub-turns.

No configuration migration is required from 0.1.8.

## 0.1.8 - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added a bounded dependency-aware agent task scheduler with normalized scope
  ownership, graph-wide timeout cancellation, and isolated parallel review.
- Added task-level acceptance limits for duration, tokens, cost, and measured
  prompt-cache hit rate, plus a protected credentialed DeepSeek release gate.
- Added a versioned, workspace-bound extension manifest validator covering
  compatibility, permissions, commands, skills, agents, tools, hooks, MCP
  servers, and templates without executing third-party code.
- Added real-browser Web UI release smoke tests, critical coverage thresholds,
  installed-package smoke tests, and generated third-party notices.

### Changed

- Moved new/resumed session I/O into an explicit bootstrap boundary so the
  agent loop constructor remains side-effect free.
- Routed hooks through the shared permission, approval, audit, cancellation,
  and secret-redaction path.
- Split terminal conversation grouping and environment telemetry into focused,
  tested view-model modules without changing the established TUI layout.
- Strengthened macOS credential cleanup and key migration, npm update rollback,
  provider capability routing, model-aware context budgeting, and MCP runtime
  lifecycle ownership.

### Fixed

- Preserved event IDs and schema-version compatibility across JSONL, TUI, Web
  UI, and trace consumers with a golden v1 wire fixture.
- Prevented agent DAG tasks from continuing after timeout and rejected unsafe
  scheduler reuse or overlapping nested write scopes.
- Kept legacy DeepSeek aliases on their documented thinking behavior while
  retaining V4 capability-aware routing for current models.
- Made `orbit doctor --provider <id>` apply the requested provider so protected
  DeepSeek and TokenDance release probes inspect the intended endpoint.
- Isolated Playwright specifications from Vitest discovery so unit and browser
  suites run through their correct test runners.

No configuration migration is required from 0.1.7.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added `orbit clean` with explicit user/project scopes, inventory previews,
  versioned JSON output, exact interactive confirmation, and guarded
  non-interactive deletion.
- Added native macOS Keychain storage for the credential encryption key, with
  portable encrypted-file fallback when the native service is unavailable.
- Added an explicit `orbit update` workflow with npm latest-tag checks, semantic
  version validation, confirmation, timeouts, and machine-readable check mode.

### Changed

- macOS installations migrate an existing restricted `~/.orbit/master.key`
  into Keychain on first credential use. `orbit clean --user` removes both
  Orbit's user data and its native Keychain item; project source and instruction
  files remain untouched.
- Interactive `/update` now updates Orbit itself through the same guarded CLI
  updater instead of installing dependencies in the active project.
- The TUI cat heart now reflects the published Orbit version rather than project
  dependency timestamps: it blinks for an available release and stays steady
  when current or when the one-shot background check cannot complete.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- Reorganized the core agent runtime by separating tool-protocol parsing,
  SEARCH/replace and log transforms, audit-diff helpers, and local package
  binary execution from the main stateful agent loop.
- Rebuilt the repository and npm READMEs around the published installation,
  project/chat workflow, synchronized TUI/Web UI, provider profiles, live model
  discovery, local Ollama, DeepSeek V4 routing, and model-aware continuity.
- Added focused agent-runtime navigation and tests for the extracted support
  boundaries, keeping future maintenance changes easier to locate and verify.

No configuration migration or runtime behavior change is required from 0.1.5.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Project-scoped chat management with persisted chat metadata, recent-project
  recovery, archive/delete controls, and native Windows folder selection.
- Saved provider profiles, explicit OpenAI-compatible base URLs, authenticated
  model discovery, and live local Ollama model scanning.
- Durable `/goal`, `/plan`, and opt-in secret-redacted `/memory` workflows, plus
  local metrics, evaluation, and trace commands for production diagnosis.
- Capability-aware model metadata, automatic context-window budgeting, and a
  task router that keeps DeepSeek V4 Flash/Pro as the optimized primary path.

### Changed

- Reworked the Web UI into a responsive project-and-chat workspace with compact
  model/provider selectors, synchronized model state, improved navigation, and
  consistent Orbit line-art branding.
- Made model switching atomic across the TUI, Web UI, provider runtime, session
  history, and context compaction so a mid-chat switch preserves continuity.
- Hardened session audit serialization, project memory, worktree cleanup,
  verification contracts, file editing, benchmark gates, and secret redaction.

### Fixed

- Prevented stale model labels and transient selector flashes when switching
  providers or models, including local Ollama models.
- Restored the terminal screen cleanly on orderly Ctrl+C exit without leaving
  the Orbit TUI or duplicate shell prompts behind.
- Corrected Web UI reconnect, project-card alignment, select-menu clipping,
  assistant-avatar alignment, and responsive sidebar behavior.

No configuration migration is required from 0.1.4.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-07-17

### Added

- A production-grade Web UI conversation workspace with direct chat, live
  terminal synchronization, recent-session switching, searchable commands,
  file context selection, approval prompts, cancellation, and reconnect-safe
  drafts.
- Rich streamed responses for Markdown, tables, syntax-highlighted code,
  collapsible long blocks, tool progress, reasoning summaries, verification
  state, response copying, and jump-to-latest navigation.
- A cohesive responsive Orbit design system with the cat mark, light/dark/system
  themes, mobile navigation, a persistent desktop focus mode, keyboard shortcuts,
  accessible dialogs, and reduced-motion support.
- Model-aware `/compact` support, automatic context compaction, context-window
  telemetry, session titles, and production release/package auditing.

### Changed

- Reworked Web UI authentication and lifecycle handling around short-lived
  bootstrap credentials, authenticated cookies, bearer fallback, bounded SSE
  retries, and isolated server instances.
- Improved DeepSeek V4 Flash/Pro routing, cache-aware context construction,
  provider diagnostics, benchmark output, token budgeting, and streamed status
  reporting.
- Split the Web UI client, styles, approval flow, context picker, event stream,
  and runtime responsibilities into independently tested modules.
- Reduced session-switch latency by reusing the autocomplete candidate cache
  instead of rescanning the workspace for every Web UI navigation action.

### Fixed

- Prevented expired Web UI tabs from entering repeated unauthorized/reconnect
  loops while preserving drafts and providing a deterministic recovery path.
- Kept terminal and browser turns synchronized without duplicating history or
  routing slash commands through the wrong execution path.
- Preserved the npm `orbit` executable on Windows and kept CLI, workspace,
  extension, MCP, and package versions aligned for release.
- Hardened context paths, event payloads, approvals, cancellation, verification
  outcomes, session persistence, and sensitive diagnostic output.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Local authenticated Web UI with responsive chat, settings, cancellation, and
  live event streaming.
- DeepSeek V4 Flash/Pro routing, thinking-mode controls, cache telemetry,
  capability probes, and repeatable benchmarks.
- Persistent checkpoints, timeline rewind, custom slash commands, and
  cross-platform global CLI installation.
- Cross-platform CI, production dependency auditing, and CLI package-content
  verification.
- Versioned `doctor --json` support snapshots with strict automation status and
  workspace-path redaction.
- Explicit configuration schema versioning with safe legacy defaults and
  rejection of unsupported future formats.

### Changed

- Split the CLI command router, terminal UI, and Web UI into smaller ownership
  boundaries for safer maintenance.
- Hardened credential storage, workspace path verification, request redaction,
  and Web UI authentication.
- Bounded and validated LSP/MCP protocol input, redacted MCP process failures,
  and deterministic cleanup of autocomplete work.

### Fixed

- Prevented workspace traversal through added files and rollback paths.
- Prevented stopped Web UI instances from receiving events from later runs.
- Preserved prompt/history behavior and terminal fallback operation during the
  UI refactor.
