# Contributing to Orbit

## Development setup

Use Node.js 20 or newer and the pnpm version declared in `package.json`.

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm verify
```

Read `AGENTS.md` before changing the runtime. The file documents Orbit's type,
security, UX, workspace-isolation, and verification requirements. The
maintainer map in `docs/MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md` identifies the main ownership
boundaries and focused test commands.

## Change requirements

- Add or update Vitest coverage for new behavior and failure paths.
- Validate external input with Zod and preserve workspace path boundaries.
- Never commit credentials, real provider responses containing private data,
  generated `.orbit` state, or customer diagnostic bundles.
- Keep constructors side-effect free and route long-running status through the
  centralized event system.
- Run `pnpm verify` before submitting a change. Release-facing changes must also
  pass `pnpm verify:release`.

Security reports must follow `SECURITY.md`, not the public issue tracker.
