# Orbit acceptance suites

`orbit eval` measures task completion from repository changes and verification
commands, not from the model claiming that it succeeded. Every task runs in a
disposable Git worktree and is discarded after its redacted trace and report
are copied to `.orbit/evaluations/`.

Review every suite before allowing its verification commands:

```powershell
orbit eval evals/deepseek-v4.yaml --provider deepseek --model deepseek-v4-pro --allow-commands
```

Use a dedicated low-privilege provider account. Do not put credentials in a
suite. Provider and model overrides can be supplied on the command line or per
task. The checked-in suite is deliberately small; release owners should add
representative private repositories without committing customer code.

The manual `DeepSeek release gate` workflow repeats bounded Flash and Pro
protocol/latency checks from a protected `deepseek-testing` environment. Add
only a dedicated `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or `TOKENDANCE_API_KEY`; never copy a
personal or production customer credential into repository secrets. Enable the
extended input only when the extra acceptance-suite cost is intended.

Tasks may optionally declare `limits` for `maxDurationMs`, `maxInputTokens`,
`maxOutputTokens`, `maxCostUsd`, and `minCacheHitRate`. Orbit reads the measured
values from the redacted session trace; missing usage data fails a task that
declares usage limits. Calibrate limits from repeated runs on one controlled
runner and provider tier instead of copying arbitrary thresholds between
machines or accounts.
