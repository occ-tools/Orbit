# Orbit Web UI runtime

This directory owns the loopback Web UI launched by the interactive `/webui`
command. Keep browser code here so terminal orchestration in the parent
`runtime/` directory does not accumulate presentation details.

## Change boundaries

- Browser-facing inputs belong behind strict Zod schemas in `WebUiServer.ts`.
- Keep `WebUiClient.ts` and `WebUiStyles.ts` as composition-only entrypoints;
  add behavior or CSS to the focused fragment that owns it.
- Keep browser-safe serialization in `WebUiData.ts` and authentication or
  redaction in `WebUiSecurity.ts`; route handlers should only orchestrate them.
- Runtime instances are single-use. Never move token, turn, SSE client, or
  event-bridge state back to module globals; late work from a stopped instance
  must remain unable to affect its replacement.
- Never expose the launch token, provider credentials, tool arguments, raw tool
  results, internal context messages, stack traces, or credential-bearing URLs.
- Keep the server bound to `127.0.0.1`; retain host/origin checks, strict CSP,
  the HttpOnly bootstrap cookie, request limits, and the SSE client cap.
- A turn must finish in exactly one state: `completed`, `failed`, or `aborted`.
- Terminal and browser turns share `../RunCoordinator.ts`, wired through
  `../CommandRouter.ts`; do not create a second execution path around it.
- Update Chinese and English copy together. Closed mobile drawers and the
  inspector must remain inert and keyboard-safe.

## Focused verification

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm test:webui
pnpm verify:webui
```

Run `pnpm verify` before handing off changes that affect the agent loop,
configuration, provider events, session history, or packaging.
